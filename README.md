In this Repository we explore diffrent methods of classifying astronomical objects found in the GAIA survery Data release 3. We use both machine learning and a neural network approach to classify objects from the GAIA survey and then compare the two methods against each other. Classification of astronomical objects can be challenging as Data releases from telescope surveys usually contain upwards of hundreds of thousands of objects. However,with machine learning techniques, we can dramatically decrease the time taken to classify the astronomical objects and improve data usability from Telescope observations.
