In this program we explore diffrent methods of classifying stellar objects found in the SDSS DR17 data release, and then compare the two methods against each other. Classification of stellar objects can be challenging as Data releases from telescope surveys usually contain upwards of hundreds of thousands of objects. However, with machine learning techniques, we can dramatically decrease the classification time and improve the usability of data from telescope surveys.
